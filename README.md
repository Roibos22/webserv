# webserv

This repository contains the source code for a complete HTTP server built from scratch in C++.

The server is designed to:

Parse basic HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) and responses.
- Utilize configuration files to define server behavior (document root, etc.).
- Leverage UNIX sockets for efficient network communication.
- This project offers a valuable learning experience for programmers of all levels. By building your own server, you'll gain a deeper understanding of:
- Core web server concepts like request/response cycles and resource management.
- C++ network programming techniques using libraries for socket communication.
- Configuration file parsing and interpretation.
